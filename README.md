MIDI/keystroke mapping tool, WIP

Inspired by BOME MIDI translator - found the software great but the scripting language a bit tedious

feature goals:
- allow users to create routines as python scripts and map these to events to alter MIDI signals
- UDFs as nodes, modular application to of functions to MIDI streams
- map input devices to several output devices
- incorporate a clock for sequencing arpeggios and phrases
